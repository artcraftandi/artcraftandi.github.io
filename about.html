					<p>Art Craft and I is a social entrepreneurship. A brain child of two passionate individuals combining their expertise in creativity and curriculum design.</p>
					
					<p>Art Craft and I believes in the philosophy that if the process is enjoyable and engaging, the result will lead to growth. 
					We design 'hands on' curriculum for children so that learning continuously happens through the most ordinary tasks and never is cumbersome. </p>
					
					<p>Connections lead to learning and our focus through our endeavour is to help every child we touch, experience the entire journey of creation and cherish the process independently.
					
					<p>On the other hand we believe that a society grows when the weakest links are supported and aided. As a mission we have as far as possible tried to involve the cottage industry in India in procuring the material required for all our activities. </p>

					<p>We believe.......</p>

					<p>CARE..... CREATE AND CELEBRATE! </p>

						<h4>Akshada Kamat</h4>
						<h5>Director & Co-founder</h5>
						<img src="images/profiles/akshada.png" />
						<p> 12 years experience in the National and International boards has helped me understand learning does not happen in an isolated environment..</p>

						<p>Many factors are responsible for the process of learning and contribute to the growth of a child.  Also it is a child’s innate ability that decides when and how he processes information and makes it a reality for himself. We as parents, teachers, guardians and friends have the responsibility of exposing them to experiential learning to build positive and proactive experiences. The entire goal of the programme is to consolidate these experiences and build a balanced, skillful, inquiry based and constructive learning process intertwined with attitudes such as empathy, tolerance, compassion to help them become lifelong learners..
						</p>
						<p>“Education is not to reform students or amuse them or to make them expert technicians. It is to unsettle their minds, widen their horizons, inflame their intellects, teach them to think straight, if possible." - Robert M. Hutchins</p>

						<h4>Priya Patil</h4>
						<h5>Co-founder</h5>
						<img src="images/profiles/priya.png" />
						<p>Priya Patil is the creative head behind Abracadabra and a Co founder of Art Craft and I.</p>

						<p>She is an experienced potter and has over 15 years of experience in conducting student workshops . Prior to this she was the Head of Resources for Pidilite Industries. She started her journey with teaching right after her graduation from JJ School of Arts.She taught History of Ceramics at the exact place where she learnt it. This was followed by stints with Prithvi, Junoon, independent workshops etc.This plethora of experience helped her to understand how children learnt, viewed the world around, processed information, expressed creativity and experienced a sense of joy and accomplishment.
						</p>
						<p>At Hobby Ideas she learned about online markets, DYI kits and content development. Her classes focus not only on art but also helping the participants in developing their own style of expression.

						<h4>Dorothy Kowli</h4>
						<h5>Communication Head</h5>
						<img src="images/profiles/dorthy.png" />
						<p> An educationist for the last 27 years with experience in leading schools like Bombay Scottish, Christ Church and NSS Hillspring International is the Communication Head of the Programme. She states the following about the value addition done by the programme.</p>

						<p>“CREATIVITY  IN EDUCATION NOW IS AS IMPORTANT AS LITERACY AND WE SHOULD TREAT IT WITH THE SAME STATUS.” Says Sir Ken Robinson.
						The developmental benefits of Art and Craft are plenty . You will notice  the development of  motor skills, language, decision making ,visual learning, innovation, cultural awareness and improved academic performance. 
						As a teacher, it is my goal to enhance student learning as a transformative experience. Transformative learning is most likely going to occur when students become personally engaged with the material and perceive the subject matter to be directly relevant to their own lives. Teaching and learning encompasses more than just thinking. Hence it is important to help the child move from the simplest to the most complex which means to help the child to   understand, apply , analyse, evaluate and create. 
						Art Craft and I aims at developing all the above mentioned skills with this skill based programme.

						<h4>Rajesh N. Patil</h4>
						<h5>Creative Head (Technology)</h5>
						<img src="images/profiles/rajesh.png" />
						<p>Mr Rajesh Patil is a JJ school Of Art Student graduating in Commercial Art. His vast experience with companies like Pixion, Tata ElXSI and Jadu Works has helped him establish his expertise in the field of Animation.</p>

						<p>He says that it was initially very difficult to believe that students would be so fruitfully engaged in a programme, especially looking at the age group and the level of energy they possessed. His experience with the programme has led him to believe that if channelized well and if age appropriate. the engagement of any child is complete and focused. Time becomes an irrelevant factor in the process and the self belief of a child in himself drives him to capably handle the unknown.</p>

						<h4>Gayatri Sawant</h4>
						<h5>Intern</h5>
						<img src="images/profiles/gayatri.png" />
						<p>TAO says that any activity done with full awareness becomes  mediation.</p>

						<p>Yes, I meditate everyday when I engage myself with art. I am amazed to see how my hands work up to build or paint something novel and beautiful. Beauty is a state of mind when your talent, skills, imagination and intellect come together. A beautiful flower is born ;flowers are the innermost core of the roots'.
						When I was asked by art craft and I for a teaching opportunity, without any doubt or any question I agreed. I realized it is this place where we are going to help kids make their roots stronger.</p>

						<p>As an artist and an art teacher I would like to say that art requires immense amount of thinking, energy, a positive attitude, a calm mind, a vision, observation skills and through Art Craft and I we are trying to inculcate a few qualities that will help the child create his/her own version of flowers.</p>

						<p>Gayatri interest in the Arts, prompted her to make a move from architecture to Fine Arts and she has never looked back. She freelances at the French school which piqued her interest further and helped her to explore the connect between education, art as a tool for skill development and learning. The freshest and latest entrant into the company, she brings in innovation through the activities she has construed and creativity while contriving these.</p>
